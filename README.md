Mobile Fault Detector - Package

This package contains:
- android/: Android app scaffold (Jetpack Compose + Kotlin). Open in Android Studio.
- desktop/: Companion tools (Python) to analyze recordings and view reports.
- ml/: Simple ML scaffold to train a synthetic model.

What I built here:
- A full project scaffold with diagnostics, benchmarks, and companion scripts.

Important notes and next steps:
- I cannot build an APK inside this environment (Android SDK & Gradle not available here).
  You must open the android/ folder in Android Studio and build the APK there. Use a debug build for quick testing.
- To get a runnable APK now, open Android Studio, import the project, and build -> Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) -> Build APK(s).
- The desktop companion scripts require Python packages: soundfile, numpy, sklearn, joblib.

If you want, I can:
- produce a debug-signed APK for you if you provide a build environment or accept remote build instructions.
- help you step-by-step to build the APK locally (I can provide Gradle commands and exact SDK versions).
